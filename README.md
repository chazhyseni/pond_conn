# The Importance of Blue and Green Landscape Connectivity for Biodiversity in Urban Ponds
- The model:
  - Calculating dissimilarity among pond communities to use as the multivariate response
  - Determining multivariate predictors summarizing the local environment
  - Identifying spatial vectors to use as structural connectivity predictors
  - Optimizing resistance surfaces and using them as functional connectivity predictors
- Community differentiation attributable purely to the local environment versus structural connectivity versus functional connectivity
- Species diversity and connectivity:
  - Classifying ponds based on local environmental characteristics and comparing differences in community composition and blue and green connectivity among pond classes
  - Determining the relationship between connectivity and the biological diversity across pond communities, and how this relationship may vary based on pond class
